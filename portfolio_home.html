            <h1>Victoria (Tori) Medina</h1>
            <p>I am a game developer, designer, and digital artist currently studying at Miami University majoring in Games & Simulation and minoring in Art and Computer Science. I want to become well-rounded in all aspects of game development; however, I plan to focus on game art.</p>

            <h2>Torisaursky</h2>
            <p>Because a lot of the art I have created over the years has been fan content for TV shows and video games, I have developed an online presence and following under the name “Torisaursky” or, alternatively, “Torisaur Sketch”. Though I have accounts across multiple social media platforms, I am primarily active on Instagram (@torisaursketch) and TikTok (@torisaursky). I have been sharing my digital art on Instagram since I started and I use my TikTok to share art as well as analysis, theories, and other discussions related primarily to the show Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir.</p>
